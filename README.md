# SplitText
Split text in Python in order to experiment with tokenization for a future post.

In this post I experiment with splitting text in Python in order to experiment
on how to tokenize text. The idea is to implement a spam filter in a future post
in my blog.

If interest in additional comments, I invite you to read the following post in
my blog:

Remember that one of the best ways to learn is to read, experiment, and repeat.

Enjoy;

John
